			"description": "A Timelock is a smart contract mechanism that enforces a time delay on specific blockchain operations. By setting a future 'unlock time,' it ensures that designated actions cannot be executed until that time has passed. This feature enhances security by preventing immediate, unauthorized changes and allowing for a review period.",
