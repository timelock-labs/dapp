# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a comprehensive code optimization and refactoring of the entire frontend codebase to improve code quality, readability, maintainability, and adherence to modern frontend development best practices. The optimization will focus on TypeScript type safety, component architecture, code organization, and developer experience while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on this codebase, I want improved code readability and clarity, so that I can understand and modify the code more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing any component or hook THEN the naming conventions SHALL be consistent and descriptive
2. WHEN examining code structure THEN the organization SHALL be logical and intuitive
3. WHEN reading functions and components THEN they SHALL have clear, concise comments explaining complex logic
4. WHEN navigating the codebase THEN related functionality SHALL be grouped together appropriately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this application, I want reduced code duplication and better separation of concerns, so that changes are easier to implement and bugs are less likely to occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining similar functionality across components THEN common logic SHALL be extracted into reusable utilities or hooks
2. WHEN reviewing components THEN each component SHALL have a single, well-defined responsibility
3. WHEN analyzing functions THEN they SHALL be appropriately sized and focused on one task
4. WHEN looking at repeated patterns THEN they SHALL be abstracted into reusable components or utilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with modern React and TypeScript, I want the codebase to follow current best practices, so that the code is maintainable and leverages the full power of the technology stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using React hooks THEN they SHALL follow the Rules of Hooks and modern patterns
2. WHEN implementing components THEN they SHALL use functional components with appropriate hook usage
3. WHEN handling state THEN it SHALL use appropriate state management patterns (local state, context, or external store)
4. WHEN dealing with side effects THEN they SHALL be properly managed with useEffect and cleanup
5. WHEN implementing error handling THEN it SHALL be consistent and user-friendly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a TypeScript developer, I want comprehensive and well-organized type definitions, so that I can benefit from type safety and better IDE support throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining type definitions THEN all types SHALL be centralized in appropriate types.ts files
2. WHEN using components or functions THEN they SHALL have proper TypeScript interfaces and type annotations
3. WHEN working with API responses THEN they SHALL have corresponding TypeScript types
4. WHEN using props or function parameters THEN they SHALL be properly typed with interfaces
5. WHEN dealing with complex data structures THEN they SHALL have well-defined type hierarchies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a team member working on this codebase, I want consistent code formatting and style, so that the code looks uniform regardless of who wrote it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing any file THEN the formatting SHALL be consistent with ESLint and Prettier configurations
2. WHEN examining import statements THEN they SHALL follow a consistent ordering and grouping pattern
3. WHEN looking at component structure THEN they SHALL follow a consistent internal organization
4. WHEN reviewing variable and function declarations THEN they SHALL use consistent naming conventions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a modern JavaScript developer, I want the codebase to use current language features appropriately, so that the code is more concise and expressive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN appropriate THEN optional chaining SHALL be used for safe property access
2. WHEN dealing with object properties THEN destructuring SHALL be used where it improves readability
3. WHEN implementing conditional rendering THEN modern patterns SHALL be used for clarity
4. WHEN working with arrays and objects THEN modern methods and syntax SHALL be preferred
5. WHEN handling async operations THEN modern async/await patterns SHALL be used consistently

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a stakeholder relying on this application, I want all existing functionality to remain intact after optimization, so that users experience no disruption or regression in features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the optimization is complete THEN all existing user workflows SHALL function identically
2. WHEN testing the application THEN all current features SHALL work as before
3. WHEN examining the UI THEN the visual appearance and behavior SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN using any interactive elements THEN they SHALL respond exactly as they did previously
5. WHEN the application loads THEN performance SHALL be maintained or improved
